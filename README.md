## Features

- **Clean Architecture:** Organized into distinct layers with clear separation of concerns, promoting maintainability and testability.
  
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separates read and write operations, improving scalability, performance, and simplifying the codebase.

- **Domain-driven Design (DDD):** Focuses on the core domain logic, ensuring business rules are encapsulated within the domain models.

- **MediatR:** Implements Mediator pattern to decouple message senders and receivers, facilitating the implementation of CQRS.

- **Entity Framework Core:** ORM used for data persistence, ensuring efficient database interactions and migrations.

- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** Integrated Swagger for API documentation, making it easy to explore and test API endpoints.

## Project Structure

The application is structured according to Clean Architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains entities, value objects, domain services, and domain events.
  
- **Application Layer**: Implements use cases and business logic using CQRS pattern.
  
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Includes data access, external services, and implementation of infrastructure concerns.
  
- **Presentation Layer**: Houses API controllers and DTOs for handling HTTP requests and responses.
